# ফল বাজার Admin — Full Control Panel v31

This version turns the Android app into the main admin control panel for the Supabase-backed fruit shop.

## Included
- Supabase Auth + `profiles.role == admin` login gate
- Products: add / edit / delete, stock, price, old price, description, category, Cloudinary image, active, featured, flash-sale, hot-deal
- Categories: add / edit / delete / active state
- Product variants table support in the repository
- Orders: all orders, customer/address/payment details, order status and payment status
- Customers: profiles list and role management
- Complaints: status + admin note
- Coupons: percent/fixed discount, minimum order, maximum discount, usage limit, active state
- Wishlist summary: product-wise wishlist counts
- Dashboard: product/order/customer/pending/delivered-sales/complaint counts
- No Supabase service-role/secret key in the APK

## Important: database setup
Run `supabase/ADMIN_SETUP.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor once. It adds the missing admin authorization policies and the coupon/wishlist/site-settings tables.

The current product schema is the schema from `mousum-bazar-supabase-schema.sql`:
- `products.name`
- `products.slug`
- `products.category_id`
- `products.stock_quantity`
- `products.image_url`
- `products.is_active`
- `products.is_featured`
- `products.is_flash_sale`
- `products.is_hot_deal`

The previous Admin v12 app was querying the old names `category`, `stock`, `title`; that caused the 400 schema-cache error. v13 now uses the current schema.

Only run `supabase/PRODUCT_SCHEMA_FIX.sql` if your live database is actually missing the new product columns. Do not run it blindly on an already-correct schema.

## Admin account
1. Create/sign in the user in Supabase Auth.
2. Make that user's `public.profiles.role` equal to `admin`.
3. Run `ADMIN_SETUP.sql` before using CRUD.

The app uses the user's JWT for every database request, and the database RLS policies are the final authorization layer.

## Cloudinary
The APK uses an unsigned upload preset. No Cloudinary API secret is stored in the app.

## GitHub Actions
The existing release workflow can build and publish the APK. Required values remain:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`

For Supabase schema changes, prefer migration files / version-controlled SQL rather than repeatedly editing the production database manually.


## In-app automatic update
The Admin app checks a small `update.json` manifest published with the latest
GitHub Release for `nahid6714/Fall-bazar`. This avoids using the GitHub Releases
API for normal update checks. From **সেটিংস / App Update** an admin can check
manually, see a newer version, download the APK with progress, and launch
Android's installer. Android may require the app's **Install unknown apps**
permission the first time.

The automatic GitHub Actions build remains `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
The older `release-apk.yml` is manual-only to prevent duplicate builds.


## App icon and in-app updates
- The launcher icon is the text-free fruit/admin logo in `app/src/main/res/drawable/app_logo.png`.
- Settings includes GitHub Release update checking, download progress, and Android installer launch.
- For updates to install over an existing APK, every release must use the same signing key.
- The automatic `release.yml` workflow therefore requires `KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD`, and `KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD` GitHub Actions secrets; the workflow detects the keystore alias automatically.

## APK updater safety
The Admin app checks `update.json` from the latest GitHub Release instead of the GitHub Releases API. Before opening Android's installer, the downloaded APK is checked for a valid APK container, the expected package name/version, and a matching signing certificate with the installed app. Every updateable release must use the same `KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD`, `KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD`, and `KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS` GitHub Secrets.


### Current Fol Bazar Cloudinary configuration
- Cloud name: `bak9nabq`
- Unsigned upload preset: `bak9nabq`
- Asset folder: `fol_bazar_products` (configured in Cloudinary preset; the app does not use this as the preset name)

### Supabase schema alignment
The admin app is aligned with the current public schema: products use `name`, `stock_quantity`, `category_id`, `image_url`, `is_active`; categories use `is_active`; variants use `weight_grams`, `stock_quantity`, `is_active`; coupons use `title`, `min_order`, and `discount_type` values `percent`/`fixed`; orders expose payment sender number, TrxID, coupon, shipping and notes.


## v28 Variant Management
- Added Admin UI for product sizes/variants (e.g. 500g, 1kg, 2kg).
- Admin can add, edit, delete, activate/deactivate variants.
- Variant fields: label, weight_grams, price, old_price, stock_quantity, sort_order.
- Uses the existing `product_variants` Supabase table; no schema change required.


## v31 UI updates
- Dashboard now links directly to every admin section.
- Dashboard bottom refresh button removed; pull-to-refresh remains available.
- Global top-bar logout removed; logout is available from Settings.
- Customers page now lists all profiles with search/filter by name, phone, or Gmail, user detail view, copy actions, and phone dial action.
- Customer detail includes available profile address and account metadata.
- Order detail includes quick call/copy actions for the customer phone.
